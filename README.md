# Bamazon
### Summary
Bamazon is a CLI app that uses NodeJS, MySQL, CRUD, and NPM. The MySQL database has a stored table of 10 items for sale, along with their price and inventory, that the customer can choose from to purchase. They can then choose how many units of the item they would like to buy, and the app will display the total cost of the purchase. Once the purchase has been made, the inventory in the table will automatically update based on the customer's transaction.  If there is not enough inventory of the item they are trying to buy, the customer will receive a message saying "Insufficient Quantity!".
